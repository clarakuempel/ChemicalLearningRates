# Chemical Learning Rate Analysis

## Setup

1. **Add Excel file**: Place `LR_DB_Clara_K.xlsx` in the same directory as this notebook

2. **Install requirements**:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy seaborn numpy openpyxl
```

3. **Run notebook**: Execute all cells in order

## Analysis
Analyzes the relationship between molecular diameter and learning rates for manufactured vs purified chemicals.

**Note**: Molecular diameter values may need verification from reliable sources before drawing final conclusions.
